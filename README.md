### What is this?
- Automated deployment for an [Open edX](https://openedx.org/) platform on AWS

### Why did you build this?
- I was casually searching for open-source projects and found a huge list of open-source learning management systems (LMS). Open edX seemed to strike the best balance between number of features and ease of deployment (and cloud support).

### Workaround for issue with Pycharm and interpreting Terraform modules (could not locate module, unknown error)
